<span class='glyphicon glyphicon-cog'></span> What was that again?</h4>
<p class='faq-answer'>We want to give EV owners an easy way to talk to each
other about the status of their charge.  Right now, we're just letting
you easily notify other people if you're charging and when you'll be done.
If it makes it easier for EV owners to be nice to each other,
we want to do it.

<h4 class='faq-question'>
<span class='glyphicon glyphicon-cog'></span> What's with this QR code?</h4>
<p class='faq-answer'>
It's to put on your dashboard.  Fill in your license plate above and every
time someone checks this QR code, they'll be able to check the status you've
set for your charge.
</p>

<h4 class='faq-question'>
  <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-cog'></span>
  What do you mean "status of my charge"?
</h4>
<p class='faq-answer'>
You can choose from 3 different statuses and add a description to each.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>OK</dt>
<dd>
  Go ahead an unplug my car.  Either I'm finished charging or it's just
  not that important.
</dd>
<dt>CHARGING</dt>
<dd>
  My car is currently charging.  Don't unplug it.  You can also
  put a number to text you at if someone has questions.
</dd>
<dt>WAITING</dt>
<dd>
  Plug me in when you're finished.  It's best to leave a number
  to contact you and leave your charge door open.
