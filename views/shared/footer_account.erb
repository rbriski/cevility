      Why would I print a QR code?
    </h4>
    <p class='faq-answer'>
    You can print it out and put it on your dashboard.  Then, when someone
    comes along and wants to check your charge status or contact you, they can
    use their mobile phone to read the QR code.  The code goes directly
    to the status page for your car.

    <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-cog'></span> What is a QR code?</h4>
    <p class='faq-answer'>
    It's basically a square bar code.  There are tons of different mobile apps
    that will read them.  Just search "qr reader" in your app store.
