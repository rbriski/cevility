      What is Cevility?
    </h4>
    <p class='faq-answer'>
    We want to give EV owners an easy way to talk to each
other about the status of their charge.  Right now, we're just letting
you easily notify other people if you're charging and when you'll be done.
If it makes it easier for EV owners to be nice to each other,
we want to do it.

    <p class='faq-answer'>
    Say I need an hour of charge but there are no open plugs.  We want to help you contact people currently charging
    and ask if you can plug in for an hour as long as you plug them back in.
    </p>

    <h4 class='faq-question'><span class='glyphicon glyphicon-cog'></span> How do I let someone know how to contact me?</h4>
    <p class='faq-answer'>
    Enter your license plate number to set your status.  In the description, you can leave your cell phone number to receive a text.

    <p class='faq-answer'>
    Set your status to "WAITING" and leave your charge door open.  You should leave your number in the description so the other owner
    can contact you once you've been plugged in.  This will notify you that you should go down and switch the payer to yourself
    if it's a paid charge point.
